  <h2>Caregiver by heart, chef by passion</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
    For over 21 years, I’ve been dedicated to taking care of people. My journey in nursing has taken me through<br>
    hospitals, hospice care, home health, and just about every setting you can imagine. Whether I was holding a hand<br>
    in a quiet moment or helping someone heal, I gave it my all—because that’s what people deserve.
    </p>

    <p>
    But my story doesn’t stop at the bedside.
    </p>

    <p>
    About five years ago, I followed another passion: cooking. And just like nursing, it’s all about care—only this time,<br>
    it’s served on a plate. My goal is to nourish both body and spirit. I have seen events - from cozy family gatherings to joyful<br> 
    celebrations -  as an opportunity to share comfort, culture, and creativity through food. Whether I’m baking a tender,<br> 
    flaky pie from scratch or plating a meal for a hundred guests, I approach it with intention and heart. Food, to me,<br>
    is a way of caring—it’s in the details, the flavors, and the connections it creates around the table.
    </p>

    <p>
    What ties it all together—both as a nurse and a chef—is my passion for people. I care deeply. I listen. I give my<br>
    full energy and attention to every patient, every dish, every guest. Whether it’s creating a moment of healing<br>
    or serving a plate of joy, I show up with heart and intention.
    </p>

    <p>
    I hold an Associate of Applied Science in Nursing and an Associate of Applied Science in Culinary Arts.<br>
    And I believe every bit of that learning has shaped me into who I am today—a creative, compassionate<br> 
    professional who brings skill, soul, and a dash of spice to everything I do.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thanks for stopping by. I’m so glad you’re here. Let’s connect soon—whether you need care, a chef, or just a good 
    conversation.
    </p>
